# My To-Do list app
A Lot of developers suggest just coding something out when you're learning, 
a to-do list is one of the most recommended practice projects.
I decided to make a much more complex app, one that i will work on even more
over time as my first big project(to me).
Thanks for taking the time to read this (smiley face)
